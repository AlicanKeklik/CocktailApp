# CocktailApp ( Clean Architecture Cocktail App (MVVM, Use Cases, Compose) - Android Studio

With the help of the cocktail API provided by thecocktaildb, 
I have developed this application where you can perform searches.
The search results are presented to the user using lazy columns. 
When the user clicks on a cocktail in the list,
they are taken to a screen where they can view the details of that cocktail,
and I handle the navigation using Navigation Compose.
The libraries used in this application are
#### Compose, Dagger Hilt, Retrofit, Kotlin Flow, and Coroutines.

Attached you can see a demo of the application
